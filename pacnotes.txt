28 columns x 31 rows
plus 2 rows above for status
and 1 row below for status area.
The fruit, Pac-Man and the ghosts
are about two characters wide.
Immediately below the ghost pen
is the message area. It contains
one of the following messages:
"  READY!  "
"GAME OVER!" (during attract mode, too!)
One of the following is shown immediately
above the ghost pen while the READY! message
is displayed:
"PLAYER ONE"
"PLAYER TWO"
The ghosts are, in order of appearance:
Red -Shadow "Blinky"
Pink -Speedy "Pinky"
Cyan -Bashful "Inky"
Orange -Pokey "Clyde"
Dots are 10 points.
Power pellets are 50 pts.
The previous scores remain posted during
attract mode.
They start out in the pen, left to right:
Red Cyan Pink Orange
Pac-Man starts out as a complete circle.
As soon as READY! disappears from the message
area, the game starts moving.

There's a cool death sequence for Pac-Man,
something like this:
  _

The first two levels are:
Cherry o6
Strawberry C)

Pacman starts in the blank area midway
between the two lower power pellets. He
starts moving left.

The Power Pellets start turned off and flash
with a period of about 2 seconds (half on,
half off.) When it's eaten, the ghosts turn blue
and become edible. The first eaten is worth 200,
the second 400, etc. Eating another power pellet
resets the bonus to 200. The fruit is worth 100.
Eaten ghosts respawn in their original colors,
but power pellets *do* affect ghosts in the pen.

The different ghosts seem to have slightly different
behaviours. In particular, the red one runs faster
than the others.

After level 2, there's an intermission where Pac-Man is
chased across the screen from the right by all four ghosts,
then a giant Pac-man chases the blue ghosts across the screen
from the left.

The title mode is similar, except that there's
a power pellet under Pokey's left side initially,
and Pac-Man eats it then eats all the ghosts to demonstrate
the successive doubling of munch scores.

Whenever a fruit or ghost is eaten, its point value floats
briefly over the spot where it was eaten.

Whenever a ghost is eaten, its eyes try to find their way back
to the pen. They move very quickly, but still behave like they
normally would when non-blue.

Normally, the ghosts have white eyes with dark blue pupils.
When they're blue, though, their eyes are small white dots
and they have mouths (wavy white lines.)

The current level is shown by the collection of fruit at the
lower right-hand corner of the screen. Each new level extends
this area left by prepending its fruit.

I've never been to a high enough level that this would overwrite
the Pac-Men (lives) display; likewise, I never got enough Pac-Men
to overwrite the level display. Perhaps some web page will tell me
what happens then.

At every 10000 points a new Pac-Man is earned.
The first fruit appears after approximately
the 70th dot has been eaten and the second appears
after approximately the 140th dot has been eaten.
Power pellets count as single dots.
The ghosts don't "see" Pac-Man unless they look
straight at him with no blocking walls. If they see
him, they start chasing him immediately, unless they're
blue, in which case they run away from him.
They move slower than Pac-Man when they're blue.

Some of the spacing in the actual game is by non-integer
character heights, and not just for sprites, apparently.
Perhaps the upper statusline characters are shorter than the
rest?

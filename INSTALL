INSTALL - installation instructions for the MyMan video game
Copyright 2003, 2006, Benjamin Sittler <bsittler@gmail.com>

Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
notice and this notice are preserved.


NOTE: If you have a broken Bourne shell (Slowaris /bin/sh, for example)
      you will need to substitute the path to a better shell (GNU
      bash, ash, ksh, etc.) in the instructions below wherever we
      refer to /bin/sh. See the end of this file for URLs for
      recommended infrastructure software.


Installation from a Binary Distribution
---------------------------------------

To install MyMan from a binary distribution, first unpack the archive
(replacing VERSION with the actual myman version, and HOST with the
actual HOST type):

  $  gunzip myman-VERSION-HOST.tar.gz &&
     tar -xf myman-VERSION-HOST.tar &&
     cd myman-VERSION-HOST

Then run the following command as `root':

  #  /bin/sh ./install.sh

If you would like to remove the installation files but leave behind
the uninstallation script, run the following command:

  $  /bin/sh ./clean.sh

To uninstall later, run the following command as `root' from the same
myman-VERSION-HOST directory:

  #  /bin/sh ./uninstall.sh


Installation from Source
------------------------

While there is a `configure' script included, using it is not
mandatory -- most configuration is done through edits to `Makefile' at
present.

Hopefully, a simple 'make' will build you working executables for all the
included myman variants. The original variant is called simply 'myman'. If
make fails, edit the makefile after reading this file, and try again.

0. Prerequisites -- see the end of this for URLs:
  (a) a working POSIX-style Bourne-compatible shell, e.g. bash, ash, or pdksh
    ---- substitute the full path to this shell for /bin/sh in each step below
  (b) a working ANSI C compiler, e.g. gcc in the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
    ---- configure this by changing the CC variable in Makefile
  (c) a modern curses library, e.g. ncurses, slang, PDCurses or XCurses
    ---- old BSD curses *will not work*!
  (d) GNU Make
    ---- version 3.80 works; version 3.79.1 *will not work*!
  (e) GNU coreutils (install, rmdir, etc.)
    ---- old fileutils, textutils and shellutils may work too but aren't tested
  (f) filesystem with support for long names, e.g. Linux kernel with ext2
    ---- old 8.3 char or 14 char name length limits *will not work*!
  (g) optional: X Window System, e.g. XFree86;
                ctheme (useful for palette setup on Linux console)

1. Configure:
    $  /bin/sh ./configure  <-- you may add options here; add `--help' to show

   NOTE: To save a copy of the current configuration:
    $  cp config.status config.saved
   and then if you later wish to restore that configuration:
    $  /bin/sh config.saved

2. Build: 
    $  make SHELL=/bin/sh

3. Install:
    #  make SHELL=/bin/sh install  <-- must be "root" for this part

4. Run:
    $  myman
  or
    $  xmyman  <-- for X Window System (also xmyman2, xmyman3, xmyman4)

See README for detailed notes.


URLs for Recommended Infrastructure Software
--------------------------------------------

The MyMan video game is developed primarily on GNU/Linux, but other
platforms may work too provided the necessary infrastructure is in
place. The following URLs give pointers to the recommended
infrastructure software; keep in mind that other similar software may
work too, but is unlikely to have undergone much testing in
conjunction with the MyMan video game:

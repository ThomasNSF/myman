myman 0.6

Added a new size (--size=huge) based on the original 1998 MyMan
sources. The tiles and sprites are even larger than the "big"
size, and the ghosts have a very cartoonish look.

There's a new configure option (--enable-monolithic) to build a single
larger executable rather than a whole bunch of smaller
executables. Built this way, the myman binary will work regardless of
where it's moved.


myman 0.6pre6

Now UCS/Unicode terminals work, provided your curses supports them
too; tested with ncurses (wide character version) -- configure with
`--with-ncursesw' to use this; also added support for the UTF-8
version of S/Lang's curses emulation -- configure with
`--with-slang-utf8' to use this. Wrote a little more
documentation. String-quoting is mostly fixed in configure, Makefile
and generated manual pages. Now our main Makefile requires a very
recent version of GNU Make (3.80) to run, so there's a much simpler
one (simple.mk) to get people started in older versions of Make.

Added a new variant (--variant=tiny) for tiny screens.


myman 0.6pre5

Improved portability and diagnostics; added experimental HTML
screenshot support (press the T key to generate snap####.html, where
#### is a four-digit sequence number); improved support for PDCurses
for X (a.k.a. XCurses) -- configure with `--with-xcurses' to use this;
added support for S/Lang's curses emulation -- configure with
`--with-slang' to use this; allow run-time toggling of dot/power
pellet appearance (press the O or 0 key or start with -o/-p), plain
ASCII-art/altcharset graphics (press the A key, or start with -a/-A),
and raw CP437/terminal-native altcharset graphics (press the X key, or
start with -r/-R)


myman 0.5

Added a new variant (--variant=quackman) with corresponding tiles and
sprites (--size=quack); also added support for multiple-level mazes,
although so far this is used only in one variant (chomp).

Added new 1x1 tiles and sprites for fonts with nearly-square aspect
ratio, e.g. linux console in 8x9-pixel font (--size=square).

Various minor improvements (manpage, installation/packaging, bourne
shell/sed/gnu make portability, etc.)


myman 0.4

Binary distributions seem to work ('make bindist'), and there is now a
manpage for myman (first added in myman 0.3).


myman 0.2


        NOTE: !!! LICENSE CHANGE !!!

        MyMan is no longer in the public domain. It is now distributed
        under a BSD-style license (see LICENSE for details.)


There is now a minimal functioning `configure' system, although
cross-compilation does not work yet (both intermediate and final
stages are built with the same tools.)

The build system now creates a `myman' wrapper and individual
executables for each maze/tileset combination. If you want to use the
wrapper, you must install the individual executables in the proper
directory (/usr/local/libexec/myman-X.Y, changeable using the
GAMElibexecdir Makefile parameter.) Use `make install' to install the
wrapper and the individual executables; a later `make uninstall' will
remove them.

Code-level changes are tracked in ChangeLog.

2006-12-09  Benjamin C. W. Sittler  <bsittler@>

	* configure: added support for --enable-monolithic
	
	* Makefile: updated for my_getopt-1.5; improved shell compatibility

	* README: updated email address

2004-01-03  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* README: re-generated the keyboard help from the text output from
	manpage

	* myman.c: now use of insert/delete line may be disabled using -i,
	enabled using -I, or toggled using the I command; this is handy on
	terminals with slow scrolling.

2003-12-31  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* myman.c (my_erase): now we only generate raw CP437 HTML when we
	would send raw CP437 to the terminal too.

2003-12-26  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* myman.c (my_attrset): now taking a snapshot inverts the screen
	for one frame (however, the inversion does not affect the
	generated snapshot, only the rendered attributes)
	(main): use of the dim and bold/bright attributes can now be
	toggled on and off at runtime using the B command, and is
	configurable from the command line using the -B/-N parameters --
	note that disabling these attributes leads to strange side-effects
	in HTML snapshots and in palette-mapped terminals!

	* VERSION: bumped to 0.6pre6

2003-12-25  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* xmyman3: always force CP437, and lie about it (by calling it
	"ISO8859-1")

	* myman.c: now we use setlocale(LC_ALL, "") so we can use ncurses
	wide-character APIs to output Unicode (configure --with-ncursesw)

2003-12-20  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile: added a separate branch for --with-slang-utf8

	* myman.c: explicitly re-enable the cursor on shutdown, since
	slcurses doesn't do that in endwin()

2003-12-19  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* configure, Makefile, myman.c: added support for the S/Lang
	curses emulation (a.k.a. slcurses), selectable by --with-slang to
	configure

	* INSTALL: added URLs for recommended infrastructure software
	(NOTE): fixed typo in spelling of Slowaris

	* Makefile (gnumake_ok_tested_version): moved to top, and added a
	note warning readers about the version dependencies

	* configure (date): unset LC_CTYPE too, in order to avoid
	non-portable characters in the date string

2003-12-18  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* configure (qw): fixed quoting to not affect non-ASCII characters

2003-12-15  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* configure: added a new function (echolinex) for quoting strings
	to display to people -- these are quoted C-style, except that
	apostrophe is not escaped; we no longer alter config.status or
	makefile.cp when they would not be changed

	* Makefile: added compatibility checks for older versions of GNU
	Make; improved string-quoting and shortened function names; added
	several pattern-substitution functions for use with strings that
	contain spaces, tabs, %-signs, /, etc. -- there's a special 'xq'
	quoting function (and its inverse, 'xu') that is used for this and
	for a whole slew of new %-patterns (which are labeled with -xq-%
	so you know they expect the % part to be quoted in that style)

	* configure (echoline): fixed a bug that trimmed trailing newlines

2003-12-10  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile: changed MYMAN to HERO in all macro names, and then
	changed BASENAME to MYMAN; also wrote a new (and working)
	string-quoting library in Makefile; now I need to add a
	compatibility test to make sure an older, non-functional version
	of GNU Make is not used

2003-12-04  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile: switched back to using ?= and other features of recent
	GNU Make versions -- in particular, $(call ...)

	* configure (configure_version): bumped configure script version
	to 0.3

2003-12-03  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* VERSION: bumped version to 0.6pre5

2003-12-02  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile (sanity-check): added primitive toolchain
	sanity-checking

	* myman.c (uni_cp437): fixed typo in comment
	(snapshot_addstr): now we only generate non-ASCII CP437 characters
	when both use_acs and use_raw are set

	* myman.man: added some more notes on the screenshot mechanism in
	the BUGS section

	* myman.c (snapshot_addstr): now we insert raw CP437 bytes into
	the HTML when use_raw is set
	(my_erase): use_raw sets the HTML document charset to CP437,
	otherwise it's UTF-8

	* VERSION: bumped version to 0.6-dev3, then bumped version to
	0.6pre4; from now on we'll avoid mentioning dev versions in
	ChangeLog, and we won't use dashes in the version number in order
	to avoid breaking makewhatis

	* myman.man: removed references to version-numbered executable --
	although it's still present, referring to it breaks some versions
	of makewhatis

	* myman.c, main.c: make sure we don't even look at string
	constants funny; some strict C++ compilers complain about a char *
	pointing at a string constant

	* VERSION: bump version to 0.6-dev2

	* xmyman, xmyman2, xmyman3: added XCurses detection and support,
	including proper colors and fonts; an XCurses MyMan opens its own
	window, so no xterm/rxvt window is opened to contain it

	* main.c, myman.c: improved XCurses support; now we allow toolkit
	options to be passed after --, and use Xinitscr and XCursesExit
	for proper set-up and tear-down of the XCurses window

2003-12-01  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* xmyman, xmyman2, xmyman3 (geometry): made the window just a
	little wider to accomodate quackman

	* configure (quotewords): fixed to work with braindead sh that
	likes to break multiply-quoted backtick expressions

	* myman.c: toggle dot and power pellet appearance when the O or 0
	key is pressed; toggle between ASCII altcharset translations and
	your terminal's altcharset translations when the A key is pressed;
	toggle between raw CP437 and altcharset translation when the X key
	is pressed; added an option -a/-A to change the initial state of
	altcharset translation

	* myman.c: reindented; made it possible once again to compile
	myman.c without any -D compiler flags, although this only works on
	systems with GNU getopt in the C library; save an HTML screenshot
	to a numbered snap####.html when the T key is pressed

	* Makefile (CURSESLIBS, CURSESINCLUDE): added support for XCurses
	and ncurses, with auto-detected compiler/linker flags for the
	former

	* configure: added --with-xcurses, --with-ncurses, and (ignored)
	--x-includes=... and --x-libraries=... flags

	* VERSION: bumped version to 0.6-dev

2003-11-30  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* VERSION: bumped version to 0.5

	* Makefile (MAZEDEFS_chomp): myman now uses all six levels in the
	"chomp" mazefiles

2003-11-28  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile: added quackman "yum pop" maze from russell's t-shirt

2003-11-26  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* myman.man: make filename references italic, in keeping with
	man(7) conventions; switched to an URL markup style (using .HTML)
	that seems to work reasonably well -- this should avoid problems
	with non-groff typesetters/filters that otherwise hide the link
	contents

2003-11-25  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile ($(BASENAME)$(htm)): ooops, the -i option to sed is not
	portable either

	* VERSION: bumped package version to 0.5-dev2

	* configure (configure_version): bumped configure version to 0.2

	* Makefile (bindist): don't send the -v flag to rm or tar
	(update-whatis): use $(SHELL) -c '...' so primitive shells don't
	kill our make on systems with neither mandb nor makewhatis
	(bindist): now we autogenerate HTML, PostScript, DVI and plaintext
	versions of the manual page and include them in the docs directory
	and in the toplevel of a binary distribution
	($(BASENAME)$(htm)): postprocess the html to replace some common
	non-ascii character references with ASCII equivalents.

2003-11-24  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* myman.man: updated to use new DIST and BASENAME variables;
	removed references to luit(1), since screen(1) works far far
	better

	* Makefile (DIST, BINDIST): renamed from PACKAGE, BINPACKAGE resp.

	* configure (cputype, vendor, ostype, build): while it's still not
	as robust as the FSF's config.guess, the build-type-guesser at
	least works on all the machines I have access to -- it now tries
	to invoke bash to echo $MACHTYPE, and falls back on a bunch of
	uname, sed and tr trickery if that fails [this should make
	"unknown-unknown-unknown" less likely, though certainly still
	possible; this only *really* matters when running "make bindist",
	where it's used to construct file and directory names]

	* Makefile: make the variant/size lists and defaults more robust,
	and removed dependency on $(if ...), which does not exist in older
	versions of GNU Make
	(date, build, host): removed lots of duplicated logic by calling
	out to configure --dump=... to calculate these variables

	* configure (dump): added a new [undocumented] --dump=VARIABLE
	option to dump the contents of shell variable VARIABLE and exit

	* configure: unfortunately the "local" builtin does not exist in
	some Bourne shells...
	(opts): the "(" prefix in a case statement is not portable either

	* Makefile (uninstalldirs): don't pass -v to rmdir, it's not
	portable

	* myman.c: fixed typo does't -> doesn't

	* myman.man: added @PACKAGE@ to the NAME section and description,
	since we install the wrapper executable with that name too

	* Makefile (install-size-..., install-variant-...): split out the
	datafile installation from the game combinations to eliminate lots
	of redundant copying.

	* README: noted that the MyMan datafiles are still in the public
	domain

	* Makefile (all_sizes): added a new "square" size with
	single-character tiles and sprites, useful for fonts with a 1:1
	character cell aspect ratio, such as VGA 80x60 extended text mode
	(SUBSTITUTE): now we backslash hyphen-minus in substituted
	variables too

	* myman.man: backslashed a few stray hyphen-minus characters

	* VERSION: bumped the version to 0.5-dev

2003-11-22  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* VERSION: bumped the version number to 0.4

	* Makefile (bindist): binary tarballs are now automatically
	created, and include the docfiles and two shell scripts
	(uninstall.sh and install.sh); GNU tar is currently required to
	install, although the script could conceivably be changed to use a
	pregenerated list of "install", "cp", "mv", and/or "chmod"
	commands

2003-11-21  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* Makefile (uninstall-files, install-files): better handling for
	manpage install/uninstall.  Also fixed recursive make calls to
	work correctly with $(PRE_INSTALL), $(POST_INSTALL),
	$(NORMAL_INSTALL), $(PRE_UNINSTALL), $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL), and
	$(POST_UNINSTALL) markers; may soon add a bindist target using
	these.  All actions that use "exit" are now in parentheses to
	avoid aborting a shell script built using make -n.

	* myman.man: renamed from myman.6; now myman.6 is autogenerated
	through variable substitutions controlled by Makefile; added some
	license text

	* Makefile: hopefully this $(origin ...) crap will work around the
	broken ?= in older versions of GNU make [it behaved as if $(value
	X) was used when referring to a variable set by X ?= ...]

	* VERSION: bumped the version number to 0.3

	* myman.6: we now have something like a real manpage

2003-11-20  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* xmyman: disabled boldMode

	* main.c: added license text

	* myman.c: added license text

	* xmyman: improved error reporting; we now pause after myman exits
	so that messages can be read

2003-11-19  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* myman.c (my_addch, main): now use_raw works correctly in
	conjunction with color, and is settable at runtime with the -r
	flag

	* Makefile (HOSTCC): fix HOSTCC to only use gcc when
	cross-compiling

	* INSTALL: added a note about long filename requirements

	* configure: now configure works with ash and with bash and
	supports parameters to --with options, even though that's not
	recommended practice

2003-11-18  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* configure: added --enable-variants=... and --enable-sizes=...;
	still needs to be rethought

	* Makefile: cross-compilation seems to work now, at least for a
	dummy case -- need to get an actual cross-compilation test
	environment to test this better

2003-11-17  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* ONEWS: renamed from README.old

	* VERSION: bumped version to 0.2

	* configure: added lots more configurable directories

	* main.c: now we flush stdout and stderr before execve(), so
	e.g. --version works correctly even when piped or redirected

2003-11-14  bsittler@sillystuff  <bsittler@>

	* ChangeLog: started new ChangeLog -- some old changes are tracked
	in README.old
